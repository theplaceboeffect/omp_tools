I'll help you execute the prompt v01.05.00. Let me first examine the prompt file to understand what needs to be executed.


I understand the task. I need to reconstruct the history of this tool by examining the commit history and source code at each commit, then create documentation. Let me start by exploring the current state and then examining the git history.


Now let me examine the git history to understand how this tool was built:


Let me get more detailed information about each commit:


Now let me examine the source code at each commit to understand the evolution. I'll start with the earliest commit:


Let me continue examining the evolution by looking at key commits. Let me check the next few commits:


Let me continue examining the evolution by looking at more commits. Let me check a few more key commits:


Let me check what files existed at that commit:


Let me continue examining the evolution by looking at more recent commits. Let me check the current state and some key intermediate commits:


Let me check the final commit to see the current state:


Now let me examine the current state of both files:


Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the tool's evolution. Let me create the HISTORY.md and PRD files as requested:
