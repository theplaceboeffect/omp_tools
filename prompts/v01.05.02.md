# v01.05.02 - Generate testing framework for the script.
Generate a testing framework for the script. There many combinations of OSes, shells, and runtime environments that need to be tested.

Do not execute any tests - this prompt is about generating a framework and tools for how to test the script.

1. Review the original scripts omp_toosl.ps1 and omp_tools.zsh to understand the functionality.
1. Create a testing framework for the script.
1. Positive Test every function:
    - Test launching the script with no arguments.
    - Once the script has been sourced into the appropriate shell, run every function.
1. Negative test the script:
    - Test the script with invalid arguments.
    - Run the scripts in different shells.
1. Generate the following file hierarchy:
    - bin/ - will contain all common libraries and tools for testing.
    - <branch name>/ - will contain all the data for the test runs for this branch.
    - <branch name>/bin - will contain the specific test scripts for each test.
    - <branch name>/test/OS-Shell - will contain the test artifacts for each test.
1. Generate the testing scripts.
    - Generate the scripts using PowerShell (this is probably a better language than ZSH)
    - Generate a test_init.ps1 script that will initialize the test directory for each branch.
    - Do not change any files outside of the test directory.
    - Simulate changes to the home directory using files prefixed with HOME-xxx.
