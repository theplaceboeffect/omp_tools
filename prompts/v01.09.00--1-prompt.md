# v01.09.00 - Port to Windows

This is a series of tasks to port dot-oh-my-posh.ps1 to run on Windows 11.

Execute the follow tasks one by one, and mark them as completed when done.

Only modify dot-oh-my-posh.ps1 and dot-oh-my-posh.zsh code.


## Understand the environment

        - where is the installation directory?
        - where are the themes?
        - what is the path to the executable.
