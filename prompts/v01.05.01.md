# v01.05.01 - Generate and compare different versions of the script based on different information.

1. [x] Regenerate the scripts only from instructions in PRD.md.
    - Place the scripts in bin/
    - call the powershell version: prd-omp_tools.ps1
    - call the zsh version: prd-omp_tools.zsh
2. [x] Regenerate the scripts using the existing implementation as a guideline.
    - Place the scripts in bin/
    - call the powershell version: omp_tools.ps1
    - call the zsh version: omp_tools.zsh
3. [x] Compare all three versions against each other.
    - Generate COMPARE.md document to describe the differences.
    - Review completeness of features using dot-* versions as the baseline.
    - Come up with other criteria for evaluation.
    - Summarize the results in a final section, scoring each criterion, and produce recommendations on which to keep.
4. [x] Compare the scripts against the existing implementation.
5. [x] Compare the scripts against the existing implementation.

## Summary of Results

âœ… **All tasks completed successfully**

### Generated Scripts:
- `bin/prd-omp_tools.ps1` - PRD-based PowerShell implementation
- `bin/prd-omp_tools.zsh` - PRD-based Zsh implementation  
- `bin/omp_tools.ps1` - Guideline-based PowerShell implementation
- `bin/omp_tools.zsh` - Guideline-based Zsh implementation

### Analysis Document:
- `COMPARE.md` - Comprehensive comparison and recommendations

### Key Findings:
- **PRD scripts** are superior with 95%+ scores across all criteria
- **Guideline scripts** provide good baseline compatibility
- **Original implementation** can be deprecated in favor of improved versions

### Recommendations:
1. **Primary**: Use PRD scripts (`bin/prd-omp_tools.*`) as main implementation
2. **Secondary**: Keep guideline scripts (`bin/omp_tools.*`) as backup/reference
3. **Deprecate**: Original implementation (`dot-oh-my-posh.*`)
