# Remaining Tasks

1. [ ] create bin/playwright_init.ps1 that will configure playwright for the project.
1. [ ] create tests called "test-launch-{script-name}" for launching each script to ensure that it is returning the expected results. See v01.07.01 for requirements for this feature.
    - Ensure each script executes in an isolated test environment without modifying system state, user configuration, or creating persistent artifacts.
    - Ensure that PowerShell standards are being followed:
        - Don't use forbidden verbs.
        - Don't use Parameter names that are reserved or already in use.
        - Don't create files with dots in their names.
    - Ensure that the script only tests one feature and only one script as follows
    - add a global test_config.json file that will be used to configure the playwright test.
        - preserve_temp_files: true
    - this is not a browser test, configure playwright to just use chromium.
1. [ ]   Verify that there are two script files.
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--ps1.test.js
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--zsh.test.js
1. [ ] Execute each script as they are generated and ensure each one passes before moving onto the next.
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--ps1 ✅ 
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--zsh ✅ 
1. [ ] creating TESTING.md to document this test.
