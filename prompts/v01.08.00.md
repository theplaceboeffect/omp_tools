# TASKS


1. [x] create bin/playwright_init.ps1 that will configure playwright for the project.
    - Run this script before continuing and abort if it fails for any reason.
    - Update the script to verify it worked correctly by looking for key files (package-lock.json and package.json) and node_modules.

1. [ ] create tests called "test-launch-{script-name}" for launching each script to ensure that it is returning the expected results. See v01.07.01 for requirements for this feature.
    - Ensure each script executes does not modify any outside of the testing environment. They can read and execute existing commands.
    - Ensure that PowerShell standards are being followed:
        - Don't use forbidden verbs.
        - Don't use Parameter names that are reserved or already in use.
        - Don't create files with dots in their names.
    - Ensure that the script only tests one feature and only one script as follows
    - add a global test_config.json file that will be used to configure the playwright test.
        - preserve_temp_files: false
    - this is not a browser test, configure playwright to just use chromium.
1. [ ]   Verify that there are two script files.
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--ps1.test.js
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--zsh.test.js
1. [ ] Execute each script as they are generated and ensure each one passes before moving onto the next.
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--ps1 
    - [ ] test-launch--dot-oh-my-posh--zsh 
1. [ ] creating TESTING.md to document this test.
