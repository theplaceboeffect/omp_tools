## Version Management
When committing changes to dot-oh-my-posh.ps1 or dot-oh-my-posh.zsh:

1. **Update version number**: The version number in both scripts should match the current git branch name
2. **Version format**: Use the format `vXX.XX.XX` (e.g., v01.09.00)
3. **Location**: Version should be on line 2 of both scripts, after the header comment
4. **Format**: `## Version: vXX.XX.XX`
5. **Display**: Version is also displayed in the environment output when scripts are run

## Script Standards
- Both PowerShell and zsh scripts should have identical version numbers
- Version numbers should be updated before committing changes
- Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Branch names should follow the version format

## File Structure
- dot-oh-my-posh.ps1: PowerShell script for Windows/macOS
- dot-oh-my-posh.zsh: Zsh script for macOS/Linux
- Both scripts should maintain feature parity
- Version numbers must be synchronized between both files

## Commit Guidelines
- Always update version numbers before committing
- Use conventional commit messages
- Test both scripts after version updates
- Ensure version numbers match the current branch name

## Helper Scripts
- `update-version.sh`: Automatically updates version numbers based on current git branch
- Run `./update-version.sh` before committing to ensure version synchronization
- The script handles both PowerShell and zsh scripts automatically
